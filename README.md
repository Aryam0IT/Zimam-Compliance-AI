🛡️ Zimam (زمام) - AI-Powered Compliance Copilot
Zimam is a bilingual AI-driven platform designed to safeguard Saudi SMEs by ensuring proactive compliance with ZATCA (Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority) regulations.

🚀 What the project does
The project automates the auditing process for financial documents and e-invoices. It uses Amazon Bedrock to perform a "Regulatory Intelligence Check," identifying potential risks like cryptographic mismatches or VAT threshold violations before they result in penalties.

💡 Why the project is useful
-Penalty Prevention: Detects errors such as "Cryptographic Stamp Mismatch" which could lead to heavy fines.
-Real-time Alerts: Notifies users when they approach mandatory registration thresholds (e.g., 375k SAR VAT limit).
-Bilingual Support: Provides actionable insights and legal recommendations in both Arabic and English.
-Smart Auditing: Links every detected risk to the specific ZATCA article for full transparency.

🛠️ How users can get started
-Access the Portal: Log in through the secure AWS Amplify & Cognito interface.
-Upload Document: Use the "Upload" button to securely store invoices in Amazon S3.
-Auto-Trigger Analysis: The system automatically triggers an AWS Lambda function to process the file.
-View Insights: Receive a compliance report generated by Amazon Bedrock (Generative AI) on the dashboard.

🔮 Future Roadmap (The "Vision")
-As part of our commitment to continuous improvement (Slide 10):
-Advanced AI Capabilities: Integrating more complex Generative AI models via Bedrock to handle nuanced legal interpretations.
-AWS QuickSight Integration: To provide businesses with visual analytics and long-term compliance trends.
-Direct ZATCA API Sync: To allow real-time filing and status checks directly from the Zimam dashboard.
